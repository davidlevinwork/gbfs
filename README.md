## GB-FS

**gbfs** is a comprehensive repository dedicated to advancing Graph-Based Feature Selection methodologies in machine learning. Our project houses two significant contributions to the field: GB-AFS and GB-BC-FS, each developed to address the intricate challenges of feature selection with graph-based solutions.

## Our Contributions

- **GB-AFS (Graph-Based Automatic Feature Selection)**: A method that automates the process of feature selection for multi-class classification tasks, ensuring the minimal yet most effective set of features is utilized for model training.
  
- **GB-BC-FS (Graph-Based Budget-Constrained Feature Selection)**: Currently in development, this method seeks to enhance feature selection by integrating budget constraints, ensuring the cost of each feature is considered.

## Installation

`gbfs` has been tested with Python 3.10.

**pip**
```bash
$ pip install gbfs 
```

**Clone from GitHub**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/davidlevinwork/gbfs.git && cd gbfs
$ poetry install
$ poetry shell
```

## Usage

### GB-AFS

#### Initialization

To begin working with GB-AFS, the first step is to initialize the GB-AFS object:

``` py bash
from gbfs import GBAFS

gbafs = GBAFS(
    dataset_path="path/to/your/dataset.csv",
    separability_metric="your_separability_metric",
    dim_reducer_model="your_dimensionality_reduction_method",
    label_column="class",
)
```

#### Feature-Selection
After initializing the GB-AFS object, you can move forward with the process of selecting features:

``` py bash
selected_features = gbafs.select_features()

print("Selected Feature Indices:", selected_features)
```

#### Visualization
GB-AFS also incorporates a technique for visualizing the chosen features within the feature space, offering insights into their distribution and how distinct they are:

``` py bash
gbafs.plot_feature_space()
```

### GB-BC-FS

#### Initialization

To begin working with GB-AFS, the first step is to initialize the GB-AFS object:

``` py bash
from gbfs import GBAFS

gbbcfs = GBBCFS(
    dataset_path="path/to/your/dataset.csv",
    separability_metric="your_separability_metric",
    dim_reducer_model="your_dimensionality_reduction_method",
    label_column="class",
    budget=20,
    alpha=0.5,
    epochs=100,
)
```

#### Feature-Selection
After initializing the GB-BC-FS object, you can move forward with the process of selecting features:

``` py bash
selected_features = gbbcfs.select_features()

print("Selected Feature Indices:", selected_features)
```

#### Visualization
GB-BC-FS also incorporates a technique for visualizing the chosen features within the feature space, offering insights into their distribution and how distinct they are:

``` py bash
gbbcfs.plot_feature_space()
```
