Welcome to the GB-FS project, a comprehensive repository dedicated to advancing Graph-Based Feature Selection methodologies in machine learning. Our project houses two significant contributions to the field: GB-AFS and GB-BC-FS, each developed to address the intricate challenges of feature selection with graph-based solutions.

## Introduction to Graph-Based Feature Selection

In the realm of machine learning and data science, efficiently handling and interpreting vast datasets is a pivotal challenge. The GB-FS project focuses on utilizing graph-based approaches for feature selection, aiming to improve model accuracy, reduce complexity, and enhance interpretability. By representing data as graphs, our methods discern the most relevant features by analyzing the structure and relationships within the dataset.

## Core Principles of GB-FS

Our graph-based feature selection techniques rest on the foundation of identifying and leveraging the intricate connections between data points. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of feature relevance and interdependencies, ensuring the selection of features that are crucial for the model's performance while eliminating redundant or irrelevant data. The GB-FS project is committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with feature selection, providing robust tools for researchers and developers alike.

## Our Contributions: GB-AFS and GB-BC-FS

- **GB-AFS (Graph-Based Automatic Feature Selection)**: A method that automates the process of feature selection for multi-class classification tasks, ensuring the minimal yet most effective set of features is utilized for model training.
  
- **GB-BC-FS (Graph-Based Budget-Constrained Feature Selection)**: Currently in development, this method seeks to enhance feature selection by integrating budget constraints, ensuring the cost of each feature is considered.
